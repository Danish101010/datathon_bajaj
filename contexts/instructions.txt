    ### Problem 
    You will be given a set of bills (invoices) with multiple pages (training data); you need to design and 
    develop data extraction/summarization models that will ‘extract the line item details from these bills 
    and also provide ‘individual line item amount’, ‘Sub-total’ and ‘Final Total’ of the bill amounts 
    extracted (sub-totals will be required only where they exist in the bill). ‘Final Total’ 
    will be sum (of all individual line items in the bills) without double-counting.

    Its important to ensure that, you don’t miss out on any line item entries and at the same time don’t
    double count any entries. The closer your ‘Total AI extracted amounts’ is equal to the ‘Actual Bill Total’ 
    -the better your accuracy.

    ### Tools
    You are free to use tools and LLM you want to solve this problem.

    ### Submission Format
    You need to deploy your solution in form of an API endpoint. The Signature of the API is as follows:

   ### Evaluation Criteria
   The evaluation will be based on the accuracy of the line item data extraction and the bill totals extraction.
   You need to submit github repository link to the solution.
   You need to describe your submission in the README.md file.
